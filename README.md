# Calendar App
The main idea is to make a calendar app that's similar to the one Google is offering. Here's a short description what it's about:

## Tasks
Here are some of the main features my app will provide:
* Basic calendar functions - different view modes (week, month, year), events etc.
* Trello-like function - Todo list
* Notes
* More calendars - so you can have for example one for your work and one for your private stuff

## Possible features
These are features I'm thinking about adding:
* Browser notifications
* Statistics - For todo list and more
* Google maps - You'll be able to choose a place for the event, or a todo task.
* More languages to select (aside from english)
* Customizable options - Google has its extensions, and I'd like to add it built-in, but the user will decide whether he'll use it or not, also there are some preferences user will be able to change.

## Expectations
My goal is to use HTML, (S)CSS, and JavaScript (of course with some API's and libraries), and write it as clean as possible. I'd like to use modern features these technologies are providing, smooth up my JavaScript, and learn some new things. Most likely I'll add on some things to it as the time goes by, but that's something for the future. :)
